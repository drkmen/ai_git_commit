# AiGitCommit

AiGitCommit is a Ruby gem designed to help automate and enhance your git commit workflow using AI.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add ai_git_commit
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install ai_git_commit
```

then run to install it:

```bash
ai_git_commit install
```

## Usage

All you have to do is to have a `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set with your OpenAI API key.

Then, just:
```bash
git add <files>
git commit
```
That's it! Your commit message will be generated by AI.

If you would like to skip the AI generation for a specific commit, you can use:
```bash
SKIP_AI=true git commit
```
